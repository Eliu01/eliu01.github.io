<h2>Passion at a Young Age</h2>
<p>For as long as I can remember I have always loved baking. As a little kid I would enjoy simply going to the grocery store, buying any prepared cookie dough, and then returning home to put it in the oven for ten minutes to watch the cookies magically grow. As I got older I started watching baking shows on TV like Cake Boss and Cupcake Wars staring in wonderment at the ability of the people on the screen to create stunning confections in under an hour. I found myself attempting such fetes, and soon my weekends were filled with experimenting and trying new recipes whenever I had the free time.</p> 

<h2>Today</h2>

<p>To this day I relish the time every weekend where I take a break from everything else and pour myself into simply concentrating on baking.  I enjoy baking everything and anything from the simple chocolate chip cookie to the more unique and decorated cakes and cupcakes. I am currently a college student at Tufts University but I originally hail from California where I live with my family and golden retriever.  I try to find the time in my busy college life to bake whenever possible, if for nothing else than stress relief and fun!  Please check out some of my creations and endeavors.</p>
